## Reporting Issues:
- Please use an issue template if you wish to report a bug or request a feature.
- Go into detail wherever possible, and if the bug is visual please send a screenshot.
- If a bug compromises user data in some way, see `SECURITY.md`.

## Conduct:
- Follow the rules outlined in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

## Code Contributions:
- If you are creating a new feature, please save your work in a new scene to avoid merge conflicts.
- Please save scripts in the `scripts` directory, scenes in the `scenes` directory, etc.
- Add comments if your code is even slightly difficult to read at first glance.

## Texture Contributions:
- Textures must be from copyright-free sources to be included in the project.
  Please list the source of the texture(s) in `images/editor/textures/sources.txt`.
  If you created the texture(s), put your own name.

## Entity Contributions:
- I advise against contributing complex entities until the logic system is implemented.
- However, 3D models from copyright-free sources are greatly appreciated.
  Please list the source of the model(s) in `models/sources.txt`, and put the model (preferably a GLTF2 or GLB) in the `models` directory.
  If you created the model(s), put your own name.

## Wiki:
- You may edit the wiki to add relevant information. **DO NOT** edit the wiki purely to mess up existing articles.
- When editing the wiki, please stay professional and on-topic, but hyper-formal speech is not required.
